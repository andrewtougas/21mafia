# 21 Mafia

A web app for tracking historical stats, standings, and records for the [21 Mafia](http://21mafia.andrewtougas.com) Fantasy Football League. The site was built with Vue CLI and uses Vue.js.

## Project Setup

To ensure all necessary modules are loaded for development, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

To test the site on your local system, run the following command, and navigate to the localhost URL that is output:

```
npm run serve
```

## Deployment

Currently, this process is done by building and compiling the production-ready code and then manually transfering the resulting distrubution directory to the live server. This process should be streamlined using CI/CD to automatically build/compile the code and push to live server on every master branch commit.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Deploying to Github Pages

Run the following command which will build the web app for production and publish on [Github Pages](https://andrewtougas.github.io/21mafia/):

```
npm run deploy
```
